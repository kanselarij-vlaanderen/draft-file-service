# draft-file-service

Custom adaptation of the Microservice `mu-file-service` to upload and download files and store their file-specific metadata based on [mu-ruby-template](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-ruby-template).

In this adaptation a different `rdf:type` is used for files that are created. `nfo:FileDataObject` has been replaced with `subm:VoorlopigBestand`. Reasoning behind it is that these files have to be "approved" in internal processes before becoming a typical `nfo:FileDataObject`.

Any further reference in this readme of "file" should be considered as "draft-file" going forward.

## Tutorials

### Add the file-service to a stack

Add the following snippet to your `docker-compose.yml` to include the file service in your project.

```yaml
file:
  image: semtech/mu-file-service:3.4.0
  links:
    - database:database
  volumes:
    - ./data/files:/share
```

Start the service in your stack using `docker-compose up -d file`. The file service will be created.

Next, add rules to `./config/dispatcher/dispatcher.ex` to dispatch all relevant requests starting with `/files/` to the file service. E.g.

```elixir
  define_accept_types [
    json: [ "application/vnd.api+json" ],
  ]

  ...

  get "/files/:id/download", %{ layer: :services } do
    Proxy.forward conn, [], "http://file/files/" <> id <> "/download"
  end

  post "/files/*path", %{ layer: :services } do
    Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://file/files/"
  end

  delete "/files/*path", %{ accept: [ :json ], layer: :services } do
    Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://file/files/"
  end
```

The host `file` in the forward URL reflects the name of the file service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Finally update the authorization configuration `config/authorization/config.ex` to make sure the user has appropriate read/write access on the resource type `nfo:FileDataObject`. E.g.

```elixir
    ...
    constraint: %ResourceConstraint{
      resource_types: [
        "http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo#FileDataObject",
        ...
      ]
    }
    ...
```

Restart the dispatcher and authorization database to pick up the new configuration

```bash
docker-compose restart dispatcher database
```

## How-to guides

### How to configure file resources in mu-cl-resources

If you want to model the files of the file service in the domain of your [mu-cl-resources](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cl-resources) service, add the following snippet to your resource configuration.

If you use the Lisp configuration format add the following to your `domain.lisp`:

```lisp
(define-resource file ()
  :class (s-prefix "nfo:FileDataObject")
  :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "nfo:fileName"))
                (:format :string ,(s-prefix "dct:format"))
                (:size :number ,(s-prefix "nfo:fileSize"))
                (:extension :string ,(s-prefix "dbpedia:fileExtension"))
                (:created :datetime ,(s-prefix "dct:created")))
  :has-one `((file :via ,(s-prefix "nie:dataSource")
                   :inverse t
                   :as "download"))
  :resource-base (s-url "http://data.example.com/files/")
  :features `(include-uri)
  :on-path "files")
```

And configure these prefixes in your `repository.lisp`:

```lisp
(add-prefix "nfo" "http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo#")
(add-prefix "nie" "http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie#")
(add-prefix "dct" "http://purl.org/dc/terms/")
(add-prefix "dbpedia" "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/")
```

If you use the JSON configuration format add the following to your `domain.json`:

```javascript
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "prefixes": {
    "nfo": "http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo#",
    "nie": "http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie#",
    "dct": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/",
    "dbpedia": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/"
  },
  "resources": {
    "files": {
      "name": "file",
      "class": "nfo:FileDataObject",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "nfo:fileName"
        },
        "format": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "dct:format"
        },
        "size": {
          "type": "integer",
          "predicate": "nfo:fileSize"
        },
        "extension": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "dbpedia:fileExtension"
        },
        "created": {
          "type": "datetime",
          "predicate": "dct:created"
        }
      },
      "relationships": {
        "download": {
          "predicate": "nie:dataSource",
          "target": "file",
          "cardinality": "one",
          "inverse": true
        },
      },
      "new-resource-base": "http://data.example.com/files/",
      "features": ["include-uri"]
    }
  }
}
```

Next, add the following rule to `./config/dispatcher/dispatcher.ex`. Make sure to add it somewhere after the rule forwarding `/files/:id/download`.

```elixir
  define_accept_types [
    json: [ "application/vnd.api+json" ],
  ]

  ...

  get "/files/*path", %{ accept: [ :json ], layer: :services } do
    Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://resource/files/"
  end
```

Finally, restart the services to pick up the configuration changes:

```bash
docker-compose restart resource dispatcher
```

### How to upload a file using a curl command

Assuming mu-dispatcher is running on localhost:80 a file upload can be executed using

```bash
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@/a/file.somewhere" http://localhost/files
```

### How to upgrade the file service from 2.x to 3.x

To upgrade the file service from 2.x to 3.x a migration must be executed in the form of a SPARQL query.

If you use [mu-migrations-service](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-migrations-service) add the following SPARQL query in a `*.sparql` file in your migrations folder. Else directly execute the SPARQL query against the datastore. _Note: this will break support for file service 2.x!_

```
PREFIX mu: <http://mu.semte.ch/vocabularies/core/>
PREFIX nfo: <http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo#>
PREFIX nie: <http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie#>
PREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
PREFIX dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

WITH <http://mu.semte.ch/application>
DELETE {
  ?uploadUri nfo:fileUrl ?fileUrl .
} INSERT {
  ?uploadUri dbpedia:fileExtension ?extension .
  ?fileUri a nfo:FileDataObject ;
    mu:uuid ?fileUuid ;
    nfo:fileName ?fileName ;
    dct:format ?format ;
    nfo:fileSize ?fileSize ;
    dbpedia:fileExtension ?extension ;
    dct:created ?created ;
    dct:modified ?modified ;
    nie:dataSource ?uploadUri .
} WHERE {
  ?uploadUri a nfo:FileDataObject ;
    nfo:fileName ?fileName ;
    dct:format ?format ;
    nfo:fileSize ?fileSize ;
    nfo:fileUrl ?fileUrl ;
    dct:created ?created ;
    dct:modified ?modified .

  OPTIONAL { ?fileUrl mu:uuid ?id }
  BIND(IF(BOUND(?id), ?id, STRUUID()) as ?fileUuid)

  BIND(IRI(REPLACE(STR(?fileUrl), "file:///data/", "share://")) as ?fileUri)

  BIND(STRAFTER(?fileName, ".") as ?extension)
}
```

## Reference

### Model

![Data model](docs/data-model.svg)

#### Ontologies and prefixes

The file service is mainly build around the [Nepomuk File Ontology](https://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo/).

| Prefix  | URI                                                       |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| nfo     | http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo# |
| nie     | http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie# |
| dct     | http://purl.org/dc/terms/                                 |
| dbpedia | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/                              |

#### Files

##### Description

The file service represents an uploaded file as 2 resources in the triplestore: a resource reflecting the (virtual) uploaded file and another resource reflecting the (physical) resulting file stored on disk.

The URI of the stored file uses the `share://` protocol and reflects the location where the file resides as a relative path to the share folder. E.g. `share://uploads/my-file.pdf` means the file is stored at `/share/uploads/my-file.pdf`.

##### Class

`nfo:FileDataObject`

| MU_APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_PATH | Mounted subfolder where you want to store your files. It must be a relative path to `/share/` in the Docker container | None                                            |          |
| VALIDATE_READABLE_METADATA       | Whether metadata of files must be readable on upload                                                                  | false                                           |          |
| MU_SPARQL_ENDPOINT               | SPARQL read endpoint URL                                                                                              | http://database:8890/sparql                     |          |

#### File storage location

By default the file service stores the files in the root of the mounted volume `/share/`. You can configure the service to store the files in a mounted subfolder through the `MU_APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_PATH` environment variable. It must be a relative path to `/share/` in the Docker container.

E.g.

```yaml
file:
  image: semtech/mu-file-service:3.4.0
  links:
    - database:database
  environment:
    MU_APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_PATH: "my-project/uploads/"
  volumes:
    - ./data/my-project/uploads:/share/my-project/uploads
```

The subfolder will be taken into account when generating the file URI. A URI for a file stored using the file service configured above will look like `share://my-project/uploads/example.pdf`.

#### Database connection

The triple store used in the backend is linked to the file service container as `database`. If you configure another SPARQL endpoint URL through `MU_SPARQL_ENDPOINT` update the link name accordingly. Make sure the file service is able to execute update queries against this store.

### REST API
